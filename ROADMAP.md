# WatchLockAI Platform Roadmap

**Vision**: The most comprehensive, enterprise-grade, FREE threat intelligence platform available

**Mission**: "Know the Threat + Detect the Threat + Hunt the Threat"

---

## üéØ Platform Overview

WatchLockAI is a unified threat intelligence platform combining:

- **Real-time threat intelligence** from 12+ authoritative sources (CISA, Microsoft, Google, etc.)
- **APT actor profiles** with MITRE ATT&CK TTPs and campaign analysis
- **Detection engineering playbooks** with SOC-ready Splunk detections
- **Dark web intelligence** for early warning of emerging threats
- **Free API integrations** for IOC enrichment (AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, OTX)
- **Universal search** across all data types (threats, IOCs, APTs, detections)
- **Community intelligence** from curated security researcher content

**Status**: Phase 0 Complete ‚úÖ | Phase 1 In Progress üöÄ

---

## üìÖ Development Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 0: Foundation & Regression-Proofing (COMPLETE)

**Status**: Complete (Nov 2025)
**Commit**: 093fae3

**Delivered**:

- ‚úÖ Git hooks with Husky for pre-commit quality checks
- ‚úÖ ESLint + Prettier for code quality and formatting
- ‚úÖ lint-staged for automatic formatting on commit
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (23 tests, 100% passing)
- ‚úÖ Zero linting errors across codebase
- ‚úÖ Automated regression prevention

**Impact**: Regression-proof development workflow ensures code quality on every commit

---

### üöÄ Phase 1: Enhanced Data Aggregation & Correlation (IN PROGRESS)

**Status**: In Progress (Nov 2025)
**Target**: Week 1-2 of November

**Goals**:

1. **Deduplication Logic** - Remove duplicate threats across sources
   - CVE-based matching
   - Title similarity (Levenshtein distance)
   - URL/link matching
   - IOC matching (IP, domain, hash)

2. **Cross-Source Correlation** - Identify same threat from multiple sources
   - Build correlation matrix
   - Generate correlationId for related threats
   - Add relatedThreats array

3. **Unified Threat View** - Merge duplicate threats
   - Combine sources array
   - Aggregate tags
   - Preserve highest risk score
   - Show "Reported by X sources" badge

**Expected Impact**:

- 20-30% reduction in threat count (deduplication)
- Higher confidence in threats reported by multiple sources
- Better risk scoring with multi-source bonus
- Cleaner, more actionable dashboard

---

### ‚è≥ Phase 2: Bubble-Up Logic & Critical Alerts (NEXT)

**Status**: Queued
**Target**: Week 2-3 of November

**Goals**:

1. **Enhanced Risk Scoring** - Multi-factor risk calculation
   - Multi-source bonus (threats from 3+ sources get +10 points)
   - Critical combo detection (CVE + POC + Active Exploitation = CRITICAL)
   - Temporal decay (older threats lose points)

2. **Critical Alerts Dashboard** - Surface top threats
   - Dedicated "Critical Alerts" section at top of dashboard
   - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds
   - Visual indicators (üî¥ CRITICAL, üü† HIGH)
   - One-click drill-down to full details

3. **Bubble-Up Algorithm** - Automatic prioritization
   - Threats with risk score ‚â•90 bubble to top
   - Sort by: risk score ‚Üí recency ‚Üí source count
   - Persistent across page refreshes

**Expected Impact**:

- Analysts identify critical threats in <10 seconds
- Zero missed critical vulnerabilities
- Reduced alert fatigue with smart prioritization

---

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Free API Integrations (PLANNED)

**Status**: Planned
**Target**: Week 3-4 of November

**Free APIs to Integrate**:
