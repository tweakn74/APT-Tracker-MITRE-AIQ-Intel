# Enterprise-Grade Threat Intelligence Platform Enhancement Plan

**Version**: 3.1
**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: Phase 0 Complete ✅ | Phase 1 In Progress 🚀
**Target**: Transform APT Tracker into WatchLockAI - enterprise-grade platform rivaling Recorded Future
**Brand**: WatchLockAI (unified platform merging APT Tracker, APT-Tracker-MITRE-AIQ, and Versedetect)

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the transformation of APT Tracker from a solid threat intelligence aggregator into an **enterprise-grade unified threat intelligence platform** with advanced correlation, detection engineering, dark web intelligence, free API integrations, and sophisticated prioritization.

### Vision: "Know the Threat + Detect the Threat + Hunt the Threat"

The enhancement combines three complementary platforms into one unified solution:

1. **APT Tracker** (current) - Real-time threat intelligence aggregation
2. **APT-Tracker-MITRE-AIQ** - APT actor profiles and TTPs
3. **Versedetect** - Detection engineering playbooks

### Eight Key Pillars:

1. **Foundation & Regression-Proofing** - Git hooks, linting, testing
2. **Enhanced Data Aggregation & Correlation** - Deduplicate and correlate threats across sources
3. **Severity-Based Prioritization & Bubble-Up Logic** - Surface critical threats automatically
4. **Free API Integrations** - AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, etc.
5. **Site Merge: APT Profiles** - Comprehensive APT actor intelligence
6. **Site Merge: Detection Engineering** - SOC-ready detection playbooks
7. **Universal Search** - Recorded Future-style search across all data
8. **Dark Web Intelligence** - Ransomware leak sites, paste monitoring (VERY impressive!)
9. **Community Intelligence** - Curated security researcher content (free approach)

## Research Findings: Twitter/X API Integration

### Current Twitter/X API Landscape (2025)

**Official API Pricing:**

- **Free Tier**: 1,500 tweets/month read (extremely limited)
- **Basic Tier**: $200/month (doubled from $100 in Jan 2025) - 10,000 tweets/month
- **Pro Tier**: $5,000/month - 1M tweets/month
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing (existing tiers discontinued July 2025)

**Challenges:**

- ❌ Free tier insufficient for real-time monitoring of multiple accounts
- ❌ Basic tier ($200/month) may be cost-prohibitive for indie/small projects
- ❌ Nitter instances (free alternative) being shut down by Twitter
- ❌ Web scraping violates ToS and risks IP bans
- ❌ RSS feeds from Twitter no longer officially supported

### Recommended Approaches (3 Options)

#### **Option A: Official Twitter API (Basic Tier - $200/month)**

**Pros:**

- ✅ Reliable, official access
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ 10,000 tweets/month sufficient for monitoring ~20 accounts
- ✅ Compliant with ToS

**Cons:**

- ❌ $200/month recurring cost
- ❌ Rate limits may require careful management

**Implementation:**

- Use Cloudflare Worker to fetch tweets via API
- Cache in KV storage (24-hour TTL)
- Update every 10-15 minutes
- NLP-based severity classification

---

#### **Option B: Curated Community Intelligence (Free)**

**Pros:**

- ✅ Zero cost
- ✅ Full control over content quality
- ✅ No API dependencies or rate limits
- ✅ Can include Twitter threads, blog posts, advisories

**Cons:**

- ❌ Manual curation required
- ❌ Not real-time (daily/weekly updates)
- ❌ Requires ongoing maintenance

**Implementation:**

- Create `community-intel.json` with curated content
- Include important tweets, threads, blog posts, advisories
- Update via GitHub commits (can be automated with scripts)
- Store in KV or serve from GitHub Pages
- NLP-based severity classification on curated content

---

#### **Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**

**Pros:**

- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Start free, upgrade to API when budget allows
- ✅ Immediate value from curated content
- ✅ Scalable architecture

**Cons:**

- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Requires both manual curation and API integration

**Implementation:**

- **Phase 1**: Implement curated community intelligence (free)
- **Phase 2**: Add RSS feed integration for security blogs
- **Phase 3**: Integrate Twitter API when budget allows
- **Phase 4**: Explore alternative threat intel feeds (FalconFeeds, Cyware, etc.)

## Free API Integrations Research

### Available Free Threat Intelligence APIs

| API                | Free Tier         | Use Case                      | Priority |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| **AbuseIPDB**      | 1,000 req/day     | IP reputation, abuse scores   | HIGH     |
| **VirusTotal**     | 500 req/day       | File/URL/IP/domain reputation | HIGH     |
| **AlienVault OTX** | Unlimited         | IOC enrichment, pulse feeds   | HIGH     |
| **ThreatFox**      | Unlimited         | Malware IOC database          | HIGH     |
| **URLScan.io**     | Unlimited public  | URL scanning and analysis     | MEDIUM   |
| **GreyNoise**      | Community API     | Scanner classification        | MEDIUM   |
| **MalwareBazaar**  | Unlimited         | Malware hash lookups          | MEDIUM   |
| **Shodan**         | 100 results/month | Exposed infrastructure        | LOW      |
| **Censys**         | 250 queries/month | Asset discovery               | LOW      |
| **HIBP**           | Rate-limited      | Breach data                   | LOW      |

**Implementation Strategy:**

- Create `worker/lib/api-integrations/` directory
- Each API gets its own module (e.g., `abuseipdb.js`, `virustotal.js`)
- Implement rate limiting and caching
- Store enrichment data in KV storage
- Display enriched data in threat cards

---

## Dark Web Intelligence Research

### Free/Public Dark Web Intelligence Sources

**High-Value Targets:**

1. **Ransomware Leak Sites** (Public Tor sites)
   - LockBit, BlackCat/ALPHV, Cl0p, Play, BianLian, etc.
   - Victim lists, leaked data previews
   - **Value**: Early warning for organizations

2. **Paste Sites** (Clearnet)
   - Pastebin, Ghostbin, Rentry, etc.
   - Credential dumps, database leaks
   - **Value**: Compromised credentials detection

3. **Breach Compilation Sites** (Public databases)
   - Have I Been Pwned, DeHashed (limited free)
   - **Value**: Historical breach data

4. **Dark Web Forums** (Some publicly accessible)
   - Exploit marketplaces, vulnerability discussions
   - **Value**: Zero-day intelligence

**Implementation Approach:**

- Create `worker/lib/darkweb/` directory
- Implement Tor proxy support (Cloudflare Workers limitation: may need external service)
- Alternative: Use public dark web search engines (Ahmia, Torch)
- Scrape ransomware leak sites via Tor2Web proxies
- Monitor paste sites via their APIs (Pastebin has API)
- Store findings in KV storage with TTL
- Display in "Dark Web Intelligence" dashboard section

**Legal/Ethical Considerations:**

- Only scrape publicly accessible sites
- Do not download or distribute leaked data
- Focus on metadata (victim names, dates, threat actor attribution)
- Provide early warning, not leaked content

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Data Aggregation & Correlation** (Week 1-2)

**Priority**: HIGH | **Cost**: $0 | **Complexity**: Medium

#### 1.1 Deduplication Logic

- **Goal**: Merge duplicate threats reported by multiple sources
- **Approach**:
  - CVE-based deduplication (exact CVE match)
  - Title similarity matching (Levenshtein distance, fuzzy matching)
  - URL/link matching (same article from different sources)
  - IOC matching (same indicators of compromise)
- **Implementation**:
  - Create `worker/lib/deduplication.js`
  - Add deduplication step in normalization pipeline
  - Merge metadata from all sources into unified threat object
  - Track `sources: []` array with all reporting sources

#### 1.2 Cross-Source Correlation

- **Goal**: Identify same threat across different sources
- **Approach**:
  - Primary key: CVE ID (if present)
  - Secondary: Title similarity (>80% match)
  - Tertiary: IOC overlap (IP, domain, hash matches)
  - Quaternary: Temporal proximity (published within 24 hours)
- **Implementation**:
  - Create `worker/lib/correlation.js`
  - Build correlation matrix for all threats
  - Generate `correlationId` for related threats
  - Add `relatedThreats: []` array to each threat

#### 1.3 Unified Threat View

- **Goal**: Show all sources reporting on same threat
- **UI Changes**:
  - Add "Sources" badge showing count (e.g., "3 sources")
  - Expandable section showing all source details
  - Timeline of when each source reported
  - Confidence score based on source count and credibility
- **Implementation**:

  - **Critical Combo Detection**:
    - KEV + Zero-Day + Active Exploitation = +20 points
    - Critical Severity + Ransomware + POC = +15 points
    - Multiple Gov Sources (CISA + NSA + FBI) = +15 points
  - **Trending Bonus**: +5 points if reported in last 24 hours by 2+ sources
