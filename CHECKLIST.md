# 2. Get threats
curl https://YOUR_WORKER_URL/api/threats?limit=5
# Expected: {"updated":"...","count":5,"items":[...]}

# 3. Get trends
curl https://YOUR_WORKER_URL/api/trends
# Expected: {"buckets":[...],"period":"24h"}

# 4. Get sources
curl https://YOUR_WORKER_URL/api/sources
# Expected: {"approved":[...],"candidates":[...],"recentlyApproved":[]}
```

## Common Issues

### ‚ùå CORS errors
**Fix:** Update `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` in `wrangler.toml` and redeploy

### ‚ùå No data showing
**Fix:** Check `API_BASE` in `app.js` matches worker URL

### ‚ùå 404 on API calls
**Fix:** Verify worker is deployed and URL is correct

### ‚ùå KV errors
**Fix:** Verify namespace ID in `wrangler.toml` is correct

### ‚ùå GitHub Actions failing
**Fix:** Check secrets are set correctly in repository settings

## Quick Test Script

Save this as `test-deployment.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

WORKER_URL="https://YOUR_WORKER_URL"

echo "Testing APT Tracker deployment..."
echo ""

echo "1. Health check..."
curl -s "$WORKER_URL/api/healthz" | jq .status

echo ""
echo "2. Threats endpoint..."
curl -s "$WORKER_URL/api/threats?limit=1" | jq '.count'

echo ""
echo "3. Trends endpoint..."
curl -s "$WORKER_URL/api/trends" | jq '.buckets | length'

echo ""
echo "4. Sources endpoint..."
curl -s "$WORKER_URL/api/sources" | jq '.approved | length'

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ All tests passed!"
```

Run with: `bash test-deployment.sh`
